# 📘 How to use?

Drag and drop files or folders into the app ⇒ Choose the desired conversion format ⇒ Click Start

You can select your video, audio, and image files all at once, add them to the app, and assign a format to each conversion without clearing the entire list or removing files one by one.

All converted files are created next to the originals
  
🔴 Important: If you select a folder that contains subfolders with files, the files in those subfolders will also be converted to the format you chose.
